      "desc": "Intro: And so Albertor fell, forcing Queen Korintha and her people north over the Titans mountains to Davokar's edge. Here Ambria was built, next to the Barbarian settlements that were scattered throughout the Davokar forest. Rejected by all who claim Davokar their home, the Ambrians are seen as intruders to the land by both the Elder Folks and the local Barbarians. With the threat of the Dark Lords and their hordes of corrupted undead, diplomacy and peace between the living races is the needed path for all civilizations inhabiting the land to survive. Unable to return home or rid the land of the corruption, Queen Korintha gathers her strength and seeks new options to help her people and power grow. Symbaroum, an ancient civilization which once spanned all the realm, now lays in ruin as nature and the corruption slowly take hold. Desperate for any of the secrets kept deep within the Davokar forests that might help return the Dark Lords to their slumber, Queen Korintha sends expedition after expedition into Davokar in hopes of finding their salvation. It is south of the Titans mountains that we start our journey, in the once beautiful lands of Alberetor. Two decades after Queen Korintha had been freed from the Dark Lords grasp. Year 21.

      "desc": "Intro: Yndaros, the city of the queen, stands tall over the golden plains of Prios. Large stone towers reach for the heavens while people toil and wonder through the streets. Known not only for its art, but also for the many wonderous markets. Yndaros offers much to the wealthy and privileged. Around you stands a sea of refugees, near 20,000 people, who fled the corrupted lands of Alberetor. To the north lay the slums of the city while to the west the great gladiatorial Dome stands ready for any brave enough to fight. The sun sits at its highest point while priests, city guards, and Black Claoks comb through the refugee camp in search of any blight marked individuals. It is here that you continue your journey. Here your fate is decided.

      "name": "Session #3 - The Lost Ruins of Hargrin",
      "desc": "Intro: News of the Flayer's capture has spread quickly through Thistle Hold providing a great deal of peace to the people. However, rumors of blighted beasts attacking in packs, dead rising from their graves, and wild monsters tracking any trespassing Treasure Hunters still fill Ambria. The most notable story, which is known by near any Thistle Hold Treasure Hunter or southern Davokar Barbarian, is the legend of The Wild Hunt. Though many have conflicting details, all seem to agree on a few key points. The giant sow, who is reported to stand near 18 foot tall, has been targeted by the Eternal Hunter, a winter elf of great skill and unknown origins. Some say the hunter has been here when Symbaroum was whole and spanned the entire realm. At the request of both Mayor Nightpitch and Grand Master Ira of Ordo Magica, you have been asked to investigate the ruins of the fallen Symbar Hurian Lo Apak, where the Copper Crown was originally taken from by Gorak and Alahara. With a good night's rest and full bellies you start your adventure at the Seamstress' Rest Inn, in the north square of Thistle Hold, at one of the center tables with mugs of ale at the expense of Ira herself.
